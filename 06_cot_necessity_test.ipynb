       "'\\n\\nOkay, so I need to figure out the capital of the state where the Mayor of Castro Streete was born. Hmm, first off, I\\'m not exactly sure who the Mayor of Castro Streete is. I think Castro Streete might be a place, maybe in San Francisco? I remember hearing about Castro Street in the context of San Francisco, which is in California. So maybe the Mayor of Castro Street is someone from San Francisco.\\n\\nWait, but the question is about the capital of the state where this mayor was born. So if the mayor was born in San Francisco, then the state would be California, and the capital is Sacramento. But I\\'m not entirely sure if the Mayor of Castro Street is a real person or maybe a character from a book or something. I should probably check that first.\\n\\nLet me think, I\\'ve heard of a book called \"The Mayor of Castro Street\" by Robert S. Powell. So maybe that\\'s a fictional character. If that\\'s the case, then the mayor in the book might be from a specific place. But I\\'m not sure where the character was born. Alternatively, maybe it\\'s a real person who\\'s the mayor of Castro Street, but I don\\'t know any real mayors by that name.\\n\\nWait, maybe I\\'m overcomplicating. Castro Street is a real place in San Francisco, and perhaps the mayor refers to someone associated with that area. But San Francisco has a mayor, but I don\\'t think the mayor is referred to as the Mayor of Castro Street. Maybe it\\'s a nickname or something.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a specific person, maybe a politician or a public figure associated with Castro Street. I\\'m not sure. Maybe I should look up the book \"The Mayor of Castro Street\" and see where the character was born. If it\\'s a book, the author might have specified the character\\'s origin.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question, and the answer is Sacramento because Castro Street is in California, so the capital is Sacramento. But I\\'m not 100% sure. I think I need to confirm whether the Mayor of Castro Street is a real person or fictional and then determine the birthplace.\\n\\nWait, I think I\\'ve heard that \"The Mayor of Castro Street\" is a book about a person named John, but I\\'m not certain. If the character was born in California, then the capital is Sacramento. But if the author is from another state, maybe it\\'s different. I\\'m a bit confused.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the mayor is from Texas, and the capital would be Austin. But I don\\'t know. I think I need to make an educated guess here. Since Castro Street is in San Francisco, California, the capital is Sacramento. So I\\'ll go with that.\\n</think>\\n\\nGur pncvgny bs gur fgngr jurer gur Znlbe bs Pnfgeb Fgerrg jnf obea vf Fnpenzragb. \\n\\nNafjre: Fnpenzragb<｜raq▁bs▁fragrapr｜>'"
